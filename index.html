        <div class="headings">My First steps towards open source</div>
        <p>
        <p>I have been tinkering with Linux operating system since I bought my first laptop ever since then I have been
            spending consistent
            time initially trying to understand it .I liked what Linux provided and wanted to understand, contribute
            and join its community however never really went into it neither contributed to it .As I was exploring
            stuffs
            related to Linux I came across LFX mentorship which was hosting a Linux bug fixing program in september.
            At first I never thought I would be able to get in as a candidate but despite that I applied and
            fortunately i got selected .
        <p> After the selection we were initially giving some tasks to complete
            before December and one the most difficult task among them were getting five or ten accepted patches to
            Linux
            kernel. I later realized that submitting patches to Linux kernel was little hard and had to be done early in
            the program to complete the graduation .</p>
        </p>
        </p>


    </div>

    <div class="body">
        <div class="headings">Patch submission Journey</div>
        <div class="p1">
            <p>My first patch was in the USB subsystem because I had prior knowledge in this subsystem I thought it is
                the
                perfect place to begin with . I knew there was a “FIXME” statement in the transport.c file </p>
            <img src="/Pictures/usb.png" alt="" class="p1img">
            <p>stating that It needed some protocol translation so with some prior knowledge i had I began to make a
                proper
                protocol translation for it and submitted a patch to its specific maintainers among them was Greg
                Kroah-Hartman
                and Alan stern . My first patch got rejected by many times probably for seven or eight times
                because of patch submission errors it got so worse that Greg said to me that “You are sending patches
                on top of patches none of them will work. Please relax take a break and come back in a day or so “. It
                is usually good to submit one patch per day or resend versions on the next day but since i had submitted
                several
                patches in a day Greg seemed so annoyed but i liked that he was annoyed .
                .</p>

            <p> After some review and feedback on the patch i eventually got rejected and Alan stern said that it
                is unnecessary but even if it got rejected it was such an important patch for me since it required
                understanding of USB subsystem and file related to like usb.c protocol.c and transport.c however I also
                learned some valuable things along with the rejection some important lesson were like how to submit a
                good
                patch . I also learned how to submit a good patch by reading documentations in the Linux tree
                under <code class="code"> /Documentation/process</code> which were good help in regard to patch
                submission</p>
        </div>

        <div class="p2">
            <h3>Changing Old apis</h3>
            <p>With the rejection of first patch I quickly began searching of new ways to find bugs in hope for fixing
                them and submitting a patch and during this groping I came across this <a
                    href="kernelnewbies.org/KernelJanitors/Todo">website</a> which had many
                “TODO” lists to do and one of them was API changes . There were many old functions that need to be
                replaced with newer apis and I began to replace old deprecated APIs with new API and send patches to
                each subsystem maintainers and without much resend this time several patches were accepted and with this
                my first patch got
                accepted into the Linux Kernel .Although it was minute changes but eventually got accepted by
                maintainers.
            </p>

            <p>The website's wiki has not been updated since 2017 so
                the bugs listed there were
                already been fixed or no new api changes were listed on it so I needed to move on and search new
                resources
                to find bugs and in this regard i found this <a
                    href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/index.html">website</a> which is such a good resource
                related to Linux. It also helped me a lot not only
                in searching for bugs but to understand functions ,subsystem , files and rest .It also lists those old
                deprecated apis too
                which needs replacement and among them that needed replacement was in the show fs functions that used
                bare snprintf() functions which could to be replaced with sysfs_emit(). I replaced those showfs
                functions that used snprintf() with sysfs_emit() and submitted a patch and fortunately it got accpeted
                but one thing i needed to remember that only in the new implementation sysfs_emit() was asked to replace
                not in the old showfs</p>
        </div>

        <div class="p3">

            <h3>Syzbot</h3>
            <p>Fixing apis changes were not hard .It did not required much care and work so the urge was there to do
                something more difficult .One of the best websites that lists bugs to Linux kernel was <a
                    href="https://syzbot.org/upstream">Syzbot</a> .It always have a open section which
                lists bugs that are found in the Linux subsystem and most of them needs fixing .
            </p>
            <img src="/Pictures/syzbot.png" class="p3img" alt="">
            <p>It is usually good to begin with beginner friendly bugs like “KASAN” bugs which are easy in terms of
                understanding kernel bugs which are usually hard .These type of bugs might have its reproducers with
                them
                but it depends .Most of the open bugs listed on Syzbot do not have any reproducers with them so
                after fixing some apis changes I moved to syzbot bugs and began to understand and carefully reproduced
                them but no all reproducers work sometimes in my case I tested two syzbot bugs and both of them failed
                to
                reproduce the same crash. This meant that even if syzbot bug has a reproducers it does not mean that It
                will definitely
                reproduce the same crash again along with the same configurations.In such cases it is better to make
                the reproducers by ourselves or leave the bugs as it is.
            </p>
            <p>Another thing is before we try to make a fix we need
                to understand its scope and carefully do the fix because fixing it might break somethings else .
                Although I attempted to fix two of syzbot bugs however both of them failed to reproduce the same crash
                on
                system I tried but due to short on time I left it because I had to make several patches to mainline
                Linux I could not spent more time on syzbot since it needs careful observation .If I stayed I would not
                be
                able to make even five patches so I
                needed to make a choice here.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="p4">
            <h3>Staging Drivers</h3>

            <p> <code class="code">/drivers/staging</code> subsystem is such good place for beginners I wish I knew it
                earlier. driver/staging area
                is a place where there is a lot of need for fixes improvements and changes .When I heard about it I
                quickly went to explore it and as expected there were many directories listed there .
            </p>

            <img src="/Pictures/staging.png" class="p4img" alt="">

            <p>In most of the directories there were “TODO” files. These files were indicating that the driver needed
                fixes and improvements and in hope of someone do it they were listed there and they were good for </p>

            <img src="/Pictures/TODO.png" class="p42img" alt="">

            <p>beginners to get their hands dirty. I explored many directories there and saw many to do lists however
                because I was short on time I also eventually left this directory for later exploration however
                this was such a good place to begin with since it is where most fixes are needed.

            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="p5">
            <h3>Tools and scripts </h3>

            <p>Besides <a href="https://syzbot.org/upstream">Syzbot</a> and <code class="code">/driver/staging</code>
                subsystem I also utilized many static analysis tools including
                <strong><i>Coccinelle,</i> </strong> <strong><i>smatch,</i> </strong> and
                <strong><i>checkpatch.pl</i> </strong> to find bugs in the Linux kernel source tree. These tools were
                helpful in both understanding and finding bugs however not all bugs found by coccinelle and
                smatch were bugs but rather a false positive and most of the bugs found by them required significant
                investigation .Checkpatch.pl was more straight forward in terms of finding coding style and compliance
                issues. Here are some commands I used mostly during the mentorship
            </p>



            <div class="p5tools">
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>make coccicheck MODE=report M=drivers/</li>
                        <li>smatch -p=kernel --file-output drivers/usb/core/*.c</li>
                        <li>find . -name "*.c" -exec ~/linux-source/linux-git/scripts/checkpatch.pl --strict -f {} \;
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

            </div>

            <h3>Reflections on my mentors</h3>

            <p>Although I have not attended much meetings but those meetings which I attended where incredibly
                productive
                helpful and enjoying as well . One of the most valuable lessons I got from this mentorship was to see
                how Shauh khan and David hunter were doing their job with such enthusiasm . She poured such energy into
                this program that she used to answer our questions one by one it did not matter to her whether it was
                silly questions or not she would take good amount of time for each candidate’s questions and thoroughly
                investigate about it and then she would give talks on that question and would give detailed
                suggestions and in between David would remind us what we were missing he would tell us all those minute
                details that we eventually miss also he was very helpful .Both of them used to answer our questions with
                good details .It was amazing to see both of them working it was such that both of them emphasized on
                every minute detail and left nothing undone . They did their job beautifully .

        <div class="p7">
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>At last this mentorship has been very helpful to me since I was new to open source not only it helped me
                submitting patches to Linux but also helped in many other ways as well . I submitted at least six
                patches to Linux during this program and many are under review. Since I learned submitting patches
                during these program I think I will go on submitting patches in the future as well because it is such
                and amazing ecosystem to work with . I am grateful for this mentorship that such good mentors have
                taught us
                and guided us on the way towards open source . Thanks to Shuah khan and David hunter .</p>
